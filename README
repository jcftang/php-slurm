Slurm PHP extension
===================

Requirements (tested with)

* SLURM 2.2.0
* PHP 5.1.6
* APACHE (optional, but recommended)

This was made primarily for SLURMWEB to connect to slurm. Any extra
interactions are welcome.

to compile...

phpize
./configure
make

this should make modules/slurm_php.so

make install as root
should install this where your extensions are in your php install

in your php.ini file add the line

extension=slurm_php.so

and you should be able to use the functions here.

Example PHP site
================

The examples directory contains a sample site which tries to show case
as much of the php functionality as possible.

Documentation
=============

The documentation can be created using PHPDocumentor 1.4.3, should you ever feel
the need to regenerate the documentation, use the following command

~~~~
phpdoc -o HTML:frames:phpedit -d examples -po c,includes,objects -t docs \
	-ti "php-slurm 1.0" 
~~~~

Administrator Notes
===================

To build an installable RPM from the tarball

~~~~
rpmbuild -ta php-slurm-1.0.tar.gz
~~~~

The above assumes that the appropriate compiler and rpm-build packages
are installed on your system.


TEST CASES
==========

It is assumed that the user has both slurmctld and slurmd is
configured up with at least 1 partition and 1 node for these tests to
pass.

Developer Notes
===============

The 'develop' branch should be used for development work and the 'master'
branch should always be a stable branch to make life easier for people
who want to roll out the package.

To clean up the directory to a clean state do the following

~~~~
phpize --clean
~~~~

The coding style that should be adopted is

Doing a release
===============

* Finalise changes
* Run bump-version script to make some version number changes to various files
* Tag repository
* then run release-stable.sh to generate a tarball for redistribution

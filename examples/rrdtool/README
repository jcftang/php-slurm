Example usage of PHP functions.php
==================================

The example here takes from

  <http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/59/php-rrdtool-tutorial/>

The examples in this directory requires that the user has php-rrdtool
and it's dependancies installed.

There are 3 simple scripts

* create_rrdtool.php - creates a rrd file
* update_rrdtool.php - updates the rrd file
* render_rrdtool.php - renders the output for one day

There is also a simple shell script to dump out what is stored in the
rrd file, it is called fetch.sh.

Included is also a sample summary.rrd database and output.
